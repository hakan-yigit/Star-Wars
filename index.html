            <p id="jedi">Once disciplined and experienced padawans successfully complete their "exams", they literally become Jedi. These exams are usually concentration tests, physical tests and other tests that determine the level, knowledge and dedication of the candidate. Known exams are: but here it is not limited to signs: physical test, courage test, skill test and confrontation test. Master Yoda trained his apprentice Luke Skywalker to face Darth Vader for the second time during his training to become a full Jedi. Sometimes, a Padawan student who performs an extraordinary (usually heroic) performance gains Jedi Knight status, as was the case with Obi-Wan Kenobi toward the end of his training, when Kenobi defeated the Dark Sith Lord Darth Maul at the Battle of Naboo after his master Qui-Gon died. The Jedi Knight is the most commonly available class of Jedi, so the word is often used as a general term for Jedi. Additionally, it is mandatory to be at least this rank to enter the Jedi Council.</p>

          <p id="sith">Continuing to improve themselves in the ways of the Force, Jedi also discovered different faces of the Force. A number of Jedi had discovered a new Force that was completely opposite to the light side of the Force: the Dark Side of the Force. Unlike the Light Side, this aspect of the Power was accessed through feelings such as anger, hatred, fear, distrust, and violence, and this aspect of the Power was used through these feelings.After the discovery of the Dark Side of the Force, some Jedi - especially those who discovered this side - fell under the influence of darkness. The Jedi Council strictly prohibited the use of the Dark Side of the Force. But despite this, the Dark Jedi did not give up on the Dark Force. These 20 Jedi who turned to the Dark Side became known as the Lost Twenties. Their rebellion soon became a threat to the Republic. The Republic decided to get rid of the Dark Jedi and captured them all with the help of the Light Jedi...</p>
